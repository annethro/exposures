1. INTRODUCTION

Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing humans (*Homo sapiens sapiens*) in the early 21st century. However, humans are no strangers to climate change: it has influenced hominin evolution, including the evolution of hominin social systems, since our Last Common Ancestor with chimpanzees and bonobos (Pisor & Jones this issue). Climate variability, such as variability in precipitation, affects human livelihoods by generating resource shortfalls. Data from living and non-living human communities reveal a number of common behavioral adaptations humans use to manage the shortfalls associated with climate variability, including building connections with social partners who live at a distance, outside local communities (Pisor & Jones, n.d.; Pisor & Surbeck, 2019). Using a typology we developed to describe climate variability (Pisor & Jones, n.d.), we hypothesize that individuals will be more likely to invest in long-distance relationships when low or excess levels of precipitation are long-lasting, clustered together in time, and patterned (as opposed to rare). We evaluate these hypotheses in the context of two communities of Bolivian horticulturalists in which individuals differ in their past exposures to drought, floods, and landslides. Our exploration offers insight, not only to anthropologists, but to the climate community (including policymakers, international organizations, and climate-oriented social scientists) with respect to the adaptations humans already use to manage climate change and how these adaptations are relevant to coping with climate change going forward.

1.1 Why do humans show flexible interest in long-distance social relationships?

Humans are flexibly interested in building social relationships that span distance, sometimes exhibiting aggression and sometimes exhibiting tolerance toward individuals from other places (Pisor & Surbeck, 2019). Though often conflated with inter-group relationships, by which researchers usually implicitly mean “between-ethnic group relationships,” long-distance relationships are distinct in that they cross community boundaries, where communities are groups of individuals who live in spatial proximity (Rodseth, Wrangham, Harrigan, & Smuts, 1991), but may or may not cross ethnic boundaries ((Pisor & Ross, n.d.); see also (Brewer & Campbell, 1976; Hruschka et al., 2014; Purzycki et al., 2016)). Indeed, the selection pressures that may have favored long-distant relationships in humans are likely distinct from those that favored between-ethnic group relationships ((Pisor & Ross, n.d.); see also (Moya & Boyd, 2015)). Our flexible interest in long-distance relationships is documented by literatures studying “expanding circles” of moral concern (Fessler et al., 2015; Purzycki & Lang, 2019; Singer, 1981), the role of “superordinate identity” in promoting cooperation (Buchan et al., 2009; Pisor & Gurven, 2015), the importance of long-distance trade in the archaeological (Braun & Plog, 1982; Fitzhugh, Colby Phillips, & Gjesfjeld, 2011; Halstead & O’Shea, 1989) and paleoarchaeological records (Bouzouggar et al., 2007; Foley & Gamble, 2009), and the structure of hunter-gatherer social networks (Bird, Bird, Codding, & Zeanah, 2019; Cashdan, 1985; Chapais, 2008; Hill, Wood, Baggio, Hurtado, & Boyd, 2014; Wiessner, 1982). Research studying behavior towards strangers often also inadvertently captures long-distance relationships because individuals who are geographically nearby are more likely to be known to a focal individual than individuals further away (Pisor & Ross, n.d.).

While bonobos and gorillas are also flexibly tolerant toward rarely-encountered individuals or strangers (Bermejo, 2004; Fruth & Hohmann, 2018; Lucchesi et al., 2020; Tan, Ariely, & Hare, 2017), the degree to which humans rely on relationships with rarely-encountered individuals is unique among the great apes (Pisor & Surbeck, 2019). Our flexible interest in long-distance relationships is likely an adaptation to our foraging ecology and our high energy throughput, suggesting that far-flung social connections have likely been a feature of human social networks since the origins of *Homo* (Pisor & Surbeck, 2019). Long-distance relationships function to manage the risk of local resource shortfalls -- especially those that can strike an entire community, debilitating everyday cooperative partners (Pisor & Jones, n.d.) – and to provide access to patchy resources that are not present in many communities, such as markets or high-quality toolmaking materials (Pisor & Surbeck, 2019). All else equal, we should expect individuals to be interested in long-distance relationships when the expected benefits of these relationships (e.g., in terms of resource access) outweigh the costs of maintaining them (e.g., travel time or the risk of attack in transit; (Minnis, 1985)). 

Because of the relevance of long-distance relationships throughout human evolutionary history, at least since the emergence of the genus *Homo*, we would expect that if an individual receives cues that long-distance relationships may provide net benefits, their evolved psychology will respond with increased interest in forming these relationships (Pisor & Gurven, 2018; Pisor & Jones, n.d.; Pisor & Surbeck, 2019). Evidence from contemporary peoples suggest that we are indeed sensitive to these payoffs, as individuals are more likely to build social ties “bridging” communities when there are benefits to doing so (Nannestad, Svendsen, & Svendsen, 2008; Woolcock & Narayan, 2000) and negative past experiences with strangers can reduce individuals’ willingness to trust (Yamagishi, 2011) or be generous to strangers (Pisor & Gurven, 2018). Cultural institutions can further enhance the net benefits of these relationships (Pisor & Surbeck, 2019); for example, seasonal aggregations of hunter-gatherer peoples can reduce the costs of visiting with a number of long-distance social partners simultaneously (Kelly, 2007), while “godparent” relationships (*compadrazgo* in Spanish) can increase the intensity of cooperation between long-distance partners (Mintz & Wolf, 1950).

1.2 How might climate variability impact the formation of long-distance relationships?

Environments are risky: they produce variable outcomes, both upsides and downsides, for the organisms in them (Pisor & Jones, n.d.). Climate, including precipitation and temperature, is part of the environment in which organisms live. Climate variability entails risk, both of upsides and downsides. For example, plants may increase fruit production in response to small increases in precipitation – adaptations work to manage the risks posed by the environment ((Pisor & Jones, n.d.); Jones & Pisor, this issue) and plant adaptations are no exception. However, large increases or decreases in precipitation may exceed the norms of reaction of plant adaptations, decreasing fruit production and thus creating a shortfall in a resource on which other organisms, such as humans, depend. In short, climate variability – including the increased climate variability that is a function of climate change (Field, Barros, Mach, & Mastrandrea, 2014) – puts humans and other organisms at risk of resource shortfalls.

Long-distance relationships are one of a suite of behavioral adaptations (which include cultural adaptations; Pisor & Jones, this issue) that humans use to maintain access to resources in the face of shortfalls. These adaptations include mobility, including short-term and long-term migration; storage, including savings and food storage; diet diversification, including increased diet breadth or diversification of crops or livestock raised; warfare, including raiding; resource pooling; and exchange (Colson, 1979; Halstead & O’Shea, 1982, 1989; Spielmann, 1986). Long-distance relationships often feature in several of these strategies, including mobility, resource pooling, and exchange, while warfare can curb long-distance relationships (Pisor & Jones, n.d.). Resource pooling among cooperative partners, for example, can take place either within or across community boundaries (O’Shea, 1981); while short-term or long-term mobility does not require long-distance social connections, migrants often travel to where they know someone (Wiessner, 1982; Wilson, 1998).

Can we make a priori hypotheses about which adaptations individuals will use to manage shortfalls? Elsewhere, we propose a typology of four contrasts that permit such a priori predictions (Pisor & Jones, n.d.). All else equal, we hypothesize that individuals will be more likely to form long-distance relationships when the downsides of environmental risk (and related resource shortfalls) are chronic, autocorrelated in space or time, and patterned. When shortfalls are chronic – that is, long-lasting – or autocorrelated – they tend to occur closer together in time or space – local adaptations for risk management are more likely to be depleted (Minnis, 1985; Pisor & Jones, n.d.). For example, if environmental downsides are clustered in time, an individual may exhaust their storage as they have to draw repeatedly on their stored resources without making additional contributions; if downsides are clustered in space, same-community members are likely to also be in dire straits, leading to the breakdown of within-community resource pooling (Colson, 1979). Further, because of the costs of maintaining long-distance relationships, we should not expect individuals to invest in long-distance relationships unless they anticipate needing them in the future. Accordingly, individuals should be unlikely to invest in long-distance relationships unless downsides are patterned – that is, recurrent. Rare shocks, or anticipation of downsides that have never occurred locally, are unlikely to favor investment in long-distance relationships (Minnis, 1985; Pisor & Jones, n.d.).

1.3 Are long-distance relationships used to manage climate variability in Bolivia?

We evaluate these a priori hypotheses in the context of rural lowland Bolivia, where AP collaborates with two communities of horticulturalists. Like many countries in the Global South, Bolivia has fallen victim to the effects of contemporary climate change, including changes in both the average and variability of temperature and precipitation (Seiler, Boesch, Mundry, Stephens, & Robbins, 2017). Among the most common natural disasters Bolivia experiences, three of the four – floods, droughts, and landslides – are all related to low or excess precipitation (World Bank Group, 2020). Further, some models project that intervals of low or excess precipitation will only become more common between now and the mid-21st century (World Bank Group, 2020).

The communities with whom AP collaborates have been feeling the effects of precipitation variability. Given the hilly local terrain and tropical climate, farmers rely on horticultural production methods rather than irrigation. While floods, landslides, and drought have been common features of their lives, farmers report that it never used to be like it is today. When AP visited in 2012, participants reported being in the throes of a two-year local drought, leading to decreased cash crop and subsistence production, especially for drought-intolerant crops like cacao and rice. When she returned in 2014, excess precipitation had triggered floods and landslides throughout the lowlands, leaving community members with most of their crops destroyed and without power, cell service, or serviceable roads – and thus without access to market foods, banks, or hospitals – for over a month. When she returned in 2017, the communities had just experienced yet another drought.

Despite these recent shared experiences of precipitation variability, many individuals in these communities have disparate earlier experiences of low and excess precipitation. Both communities are characterized by migration: while some individuals were born elsewhere and migrated to the community, others engage in short-term migration to participate in migrant labor, complete mandatory military service, or have extended visits with friends or family. Given that participants differ in their exposure to low and excess precipitation, we can expect that their interest in long-distance relationships may likewise vary.

If long-distance relationships are indeed an adaptation that individuals use to manage resource shortfalls when shortfalls tend to be chronic, temporally autocorrelated, and/or patterned (as opposed to rare shocks), we would expect individuals who have chronic, temporally autocorrelated, and/or patterned exposure to low or excess levels of precipitation to invest more in long-distance relationships, all else equal. (As low levels of precipitation entail drought, while high levels can trigger both floods and landslides, we use drought as synonymous for low levels here.) Given the relevance of low and excess precipitation to Bolivian horticulturalists, we make the following predictions with respect to their long-distance relationships:

(H1) Individuals who have more experience with chronic drought or chronic excess precipitation will be more likely to report having long-distance social relationships than those who have less chronic exposure to low or excess precipitation.

(P1) Participants who have, on average, experienced longer intervals of drought or of excess precipitation will report a greater number of friendships with people who live outside their community.

(H2) Individuals who have experienced more temporal autocorrelation between intervals of drought or of excess precipitation will be more likely to report having long-distance social relationships than those who have experienced less temporal autocorrelation.

(P2) Participants who have experienced longer runs of months of drought or of excess precipitation will report a greater number of friendships with people who live outside their community.

(H3) Individuals who have experienced patterned low or patterned excess precipitation will be more likely to report having long-distance social relationships than those who have experienced low or excess precipitation as rare shocks.

(P3) Participants who have experienced a greater number of months of drought or of excess precipitation, scaled by the months for which we have data on their precipitation exposure, will report a greater number of friendships with people who live outside their community.

Further, to evaluate whether chronic, temporally autocorrelated, and/or patterned exposure to drought or excess precipitation increases investment in long-distance relationships or in all resource-pooling social relationships, we evaluate each of the above predictions with respect to reciprocity-based *within*-community relationships as well.

2. METHODS
2.1 Collaborating communities

2.2 Data collection

In March-June 2017, AP interview participants (n=119) about their migration histories, friends who they do not see in person often, and whether there is a member of their community with whom they have a reciprocal cooperative relationship. Given variable literacy across participants but familiarity with signing documents, consent forms were read aloud and participants provided written (that is, signed) consent. All field protocols were approved by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology Department of Human Behavior, Ecology, and Culture, and declared exempt from additional IRB oversight.
